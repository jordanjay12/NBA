In order to have external javascript files connected to the HTML/EJS files we just need to include a regular script tag
however this time the src will be to the scripts folder within the public directory

example: <script src="scripts/standings.js"></script> - WORKS
alternatively: <script src="../scripts/<file.js>"</script> - ALSO WORKS

The running application can be found at whatever port number your application is configured to.
    ex. localhost:3000


Environment Variables:
    Environment variables need to be set for the username and password to the "mysportsfeed" API
    ex.
        Set Environment Variables (console):

            Linux/Unix
            1. export NBAUSERNAME=<username>
            2. export NBAPASSWORD=<password>

            Windows
            1. set NBAUSERNAME=<username>
            2. set NBAPASSWORD=<password>

        Retrieve Environment Variables (node.js):
            1. process.env.NBAUSERNAME
            2. process.env.NBAPASSWORD

    Additionally, the "PORT" may need to be specified in your environment variables, ex PORT: 3000


Problems with playoffs:
1. The progress of the game currently isn't working
2. When the game hasn't been played yet, and we are trying to view the game on the game page it is crashing the application


Things that still need to be completed/fixed:

1. Need to change the backend so that we are looking at the date and if we have to we should be displaying information about playoff games as well.
    Also need to clean up the backend, there is a bunch of redundant code, now just call the function at the end of the file for retrieving information.
2. Since we have the date on the game.ejs page - use that date to display in the header the date before and the date afters games.
3. On the players page add a button that will always be visible on the page that will re-direct the user back to the top of the page
    the page is long with all the available players
4. Still need to add a favicon to each of the pages if possible, otherwise just use a generic NBA one - this has now been completed
5. Have the scores on the schedule page (when displaying the live scores) automatically be refreshed at some interval
    On the home page, when only one game is selected I should probably also have the interval be set there as well
    Also have the scores on an individual game also be refreshed at some interval
6. When the game is in overtime, it currently says quarter 5, but instead I want it to display which overtime it is actually in
7. Get the game Staring lineups - however often times there isn't any data that is actually being returned yet.
8. Changes still need to be made to the League Leaders page
    include a loading icon while the table is loading - quite large becausae it contains data on all available players

9. League Leaders Page
    Figure out if I can ge the drop-down menu working properly and having it scroll horizontally to the proper column
    Change the background color of the row on hover as well to make it more obvious which row the user is hovering over
    Still need to figure out if I can hide the table while it is loading, and then have it appear after
    There are some font awesome loading icons that I could display, but I would need to have it overlap over top of the table
10. Since we have so many dynamic pages now, it is probably best that I didn't use the same header and footer ejs files for all the views anymore, instead change it so that each page can specify their own header, and thus its own title
11. There are still a couple of problems when on the game.ejs page where the game is complete and it actually says complete, but the score isn't updated to the final score.
12. When there are no games to display for a particular day, I just display that there is nothing to display for that day, however I should still have some buttons so that users can navigate to the previous and next day.
    Currently the only thing there is, is what is in the header, but because I do everything in the if statement, I am going to need to
    change the header as well.

MAJOR BUG:
1. When games are first starting there is still an instance that isn't being caught and games are displaying NaN for quarter and time remaining
    Futhermore, trying to view more of this game will also throw an error, I guess nothing could properly be returned from the call.
2. Some Error handling will need to be performed on the possible dates that can be added through the date selector.



BUGS:

2. Rebounds and play time is messed up still - but I think that just has to do with what is being returned in the data
7. Apparently with game boxscore, I can sort the order that things are being returned, maybe I can do the sorting there to sort by time played, or points scored.
9. Currently I have nothing on game.ejs for checking if the game is a playoff game or not
    something within the fetchData function on the server side will have to check for this...
10. I think there is still a bug at the very end of the game if it is changed to currentIntermission = 4, but the game is actually over, without refreshing the page, it currently doesn't display the game is over, even if it is actually over.
